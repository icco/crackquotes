Most people do not think making backups of their files is worth the time and effort--until one fine day their disk abruptly dies, at which time most of them undergo a deathbed conversion.
  -- Andrew Tanenbaum, _Modern Operating Systems_
%
In practice, [natural catastrophes] do not happen very often, which is why many people do not bother with backups. These people also tend not to have fire insurance on their houses for the same reason.
  -- Andrew Tanenbaum, _Modern Operating Systems_
%
The use of this redundant [little-endian and big-endian] coding was necessary to avoid huring anyone's feelings when the [ISO 9660] standard was developed. If the standard had dictated little endian, then people from companies whose products were big endian would have felt like second-class citizens and would not have accepted the standard. The emotional content of a CD-ROM can thus be quantified and measured exactly in kilobytes/hour of wasted space.
  -- Andrew Tanenbaum, _Modern Operating Systems_
%
[ISO 9660] Years begin to count at 1900, which means that CD-ROMs will suffer from a Y2156 problem because the year following 2155 will be 1900. This problem could have been delayed by defining the origin time to be 1988 (the year the standard was adopted). Had that been done, the problem would have been postponed until 2244. Every 88 extra years helps.
