William's collection of quotes.

Run strfile against this file to create an index. Debian and derivatives include this in the fortune package, other distributions hide it in another package. Red Hat seems to install the binary under /usr/sbin.

Once the index is created,
fortune my-fortunes

in the correct directory will generate a fortune.

After you add or change a fortune, run strfile again.

These fortunes were intended to be piped into Thunderbird or another application with decent word-wrapping functionality. As such, reading them on the command line or another place that lacks good word-wrap support may be uncomfortable.
