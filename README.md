# CrackQuotes.

A repository to prevent good quotes from falling through the cracks.

## Add these quotes to your fortune

First download this repo and install fortune,

 * Debian: `apt-get install fortune-mod`
 * Fedora: `yum install fortune-mode`
 * Gentoo: `emerge fortune-mod`

There is a simple make file in this repo, so you can just run `make` and then `fortune crackquotes` in this directory and a fortune will appear.

After you add or change a fortune, run make again.

## Notes

These fortunes were intended to be piped into Thunderbird or another application with decent word-wrapping functionality. As such, reading them on the command line or another place that lacks good word-wrap support may be uncomfortable.

## Adding Quotes

Fork this quote repository. Try to keep each commit to one or two quotes. If we find your quote funny we may pull it upstream.
